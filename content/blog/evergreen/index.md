A month ago, I attended the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2024 meetings in Denver, Colorado. These conferences are premier events in the genetics field and I have always looked forward presentations on groundbreaking research and the latest analytical tools. However, what excite me is the wealth of excellent resources available for early-career researchers who are at the brink of thesis completion and exploring career options. Where better to explore the diverse tracks available, than at a conference where the movers and shakers in genetics, industry partners and esteemed institutions alike, and ambitious young scientists at the brink of completing grad school come together to connect? 

I followed the [curated career itinerary](https://eppro02.ativ.me/web/planner.php?id=ASHG24&tabid=31) that included an exciting lineup of events. In this post, I’m going to share my takeaways a one-on-one career coaching session. I arrived at my Thursday morning appointment with my CV and a specific job that caught my interest while browsing ASHG’s [job portal](https://careers.ashg.org/employers/): the [Harvard Curriculum Fellow](https://curriculumfellows.hms.harvard.edu/) position (this is a teaching-focused postdoctoral role; if you are a Ph.D. student aiming for a teaching-heavy rather than a research-heavy postdoctoral career, check this out!) Although I had no intention to apply, having an actual job description that aligned with my skills and aspirations helped my career coach, [Dora Esparza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dora-esparza-mnm-mapy-mpm-mhrm-mol-mba-66829923/), provide concrete and targeted recommendations for improving my CV. **(Pro tip 1: If attending a career coaching session, always send in an updated CV and your ideal job description in advance!)** From Dora’s extensive experience, I gained valuable and practicable tips on crafting a fulfilling and enjoyable job application process. **If you’re in your third or final year of PhD,** I believe that any sensing you’ve had of your skills and aspirations would be adequate to start **crafting a meaningful job search strategy** 


### Rmarkdown

In `.Rmarkdown` documents, you can use either

```
$a \ne 0$
```

to get inline math: `\(a \ne 0\)`.
There is no conflict with using dollar symbols regularly, because `knitr` automatically escapes freestanding dollar symbols.

And you can use

```
$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```

to get a math paragraph:

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

### md

In `.md` documents, you can **not** use the single dollar syntax.
The double dollar syntax still gives you a math paragraph.

```
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

In order to get inline equations, use:

```
`\(a \ne 0\)`
or
\\(a \ne 0\\)
```

to get: `\(a \ne 0\)`.
