A month ago, I attended the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2024 meetings in Denver, Colorado. These conferences are premier events in the genetics field and I have always looked forward presentations on groundbreaking research and the latest analytical tools. However, what excite me is the wealth of excellent resources available for early-career researchers who are at the brink of thesis completion and exploring career options. Where better to explore the diverse tracks available, than at a conference where the movers and shakers in genetics, industry partners and esteemed institutions alike, and ambitious young scientists at the brink of completing grad school come together to connect? 

I followed the [curated career itinerary](https://eppro02.ativ.me/web/planner.php?id=ASHG24&tabid=31) that included an exciting lineup of events. In this post, I’m going to share my takeaways a one-on-one career coaching session. I arrived at my Thursday morning appointment with my CV and a specific job that caught my interest while browsing ASHG’s [job portal](https://careers.ashg.org/employers/): the [Harvard Curriculum Fellow](https://curriculumfellows.hms.harvard.edu/) position (this is a teaching-focused postdoctoral role; if you are a Ph.D. student aiming for a teaching-heavy rather than a research-heavy postdoctoral career, check this out!) Although I had no intention to apply, having an actual job description that aligned with my skills and aspirations helped my career coach, [Dora Esparza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dora-esparza-mnm-mapy-mpm-mhrm-mol-mba-66829923/), provide concrete and targeted recommendations for improving my CV. **(Pro tip 1: If attending a career coaching session, always send in an updated CV and your ideal job description in advance!)** From Dora’s extensive experience, I gained valuable and practicable tips on crafting a fulfilling and enjoyable job application process. **If you’re in your third or final year of PhD,** I believe that any sensing you’ve had of your skills and aspirations would be adequate to start **crafting a meaningful job search strategy** 

### **Making your Job Search Fun and Relational: a Step-by-Step Process**

During the session, Dora suggested a detailed step-by-step approach to the job search.  Caveat: this is a slow and gradual approach that works best for individuals who aren’t in a hurry to seek employment. Which brings me to **pro tip 2: it’s NEVER TOO EARLY to start a job search!**

Here’s a breakdown of the process:

1. **Research the Job Description**: Search for and download job descriptions. Read through them thoroughly, highlighting the skills and qualifications required. 
2. **Tailor your CV according to job requirements**. Prioritise relevant experiences and skills. This is especially pertinent when the job we are applying for requires skills that we have not spent the bulk of our time on so far. For instance, Dora advises Ph.D. students who are applying for teaching-focused positions to consider placing their teaching experience above their publications, even though the bulk of their time may have been spent on research.
3. **Craft a Compelling Objective statement.** Begin with an objective statement that clearly articulates your aspirations for the position. This allows employers, who have many CVs to look through to quickly grasp your intentions before reviewing your past experiences in detail. For example, if most of your background is in research, it may not be immediately clear how you can contribute to education. Based on Dora’s input, my revised statement is: “To enhance student engagement and skills in data-driven biological research by leveraging my expertise in computational biology and proven STEM teaching experience with undergraduate and postgraduate students.” 
4. **Engage with Current Employees**: Reach out to individuals currently in the role or at the institution to gain insights into their experiences. Coffee chats, scheduled Zoom meetings, or phone calls (to company numbers) work well. Dora recommends starting with a request for just 10-15 minutes of their time to make it manageable for their busy schedules. For an introductory chat, ask questions like, “What does a typical day look like in this position?” Depending on the conversational flow, you might also inquire with casual, open-ended questions such as, “What do you enjoy most about working here?” Their responses can offer valuable insights into the company culture and overall working experience. 
5. **Prepare Thoughtful Questions for Interviews**: While introductory conversations often lend themselves to open-ended inquiries, interviews provide an opportunity to delve into specifics about the role. Consider asking targeted questions such as, “Does this position involve extensive collaborative work?” or “What are the company’s policies on remote work?” These questions will help you assess whether the job aligns with your work style and preferences.
6. **Develop a Personal Website**: Consider creating a personal website to showcase your work and achievements. As most CVs have 2-page word-limit, a personal website could be a good place to house the details of past work experiences. Additionally, a blog section on the website can offer a platform for you to effectively demonstrate your critical thinking, ability to engage in discourse within the field, and communication skills: attributes that employers will look out for but which are difficult to assess through a listing of past experiences and accomplishments. 

Job searching can be good fun when we embrace it as a journey of discovery: about ourselves, about what we can bring to the table. With each of these steps comes greater clarity and confidence that we are on the right path to securing a job that aligns with our values, skills, aspirations, and priorities in life.

After the session, I thought much about Dora's insights on the relational nature of job applications. She emphasized that “employers want to speak to you before receiving your CV.” Establishing personal connections early in the hiring process can significantly influence the overall interaction, enhancing a candidate's chances of making a positive impression. However, the choice between a relational approach—like face-to-face meetings or calls—and cold-emailing CVs is not a straightforward one to make. In response to a job seeker who felt overwhelmed by the process, a redditor who has succeeded in competitive job search processes proposed a strategy called "[multi-threading.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerSuccess/comments/16ui3ha/advice_on_cold_emailing_potential_employers/)" I think therein lies the key: many factors outside of our control and many methods may come into play when eventually landing a job that’s a good fit, but **so much hinges on cultivating genuine interest** in the job and the onus is on us to spend the time we have during our PhD years developing and showcasing the skills that we know our dream jobs require. 

How fulfilling could our job search experience be if we started early, so that we could play the long game? I was amused and impacted when Dora likened of job searching to dating, pointing out that both require building connections and understanding mutual interests— and time. I hope that from these insights, you will find thing or two that have made you want to own your career journey early on and along the way, have your eyes opened to the many possibilities within STEM!
