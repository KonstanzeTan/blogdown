  One of my favourite quotes is, “To teach something is to learn it twice.” I believe this because when I was failing math in secondary school, the thing that got me from the doldrums in Year 2 to an A grade when I graduated wasn’t tuition or extra lessons, it was staying back after school every day to teach a friend math. In this spirit, I write to deepen my understanding of the things I’ve heard and seen. I create tutorials to unravel complex concepts. And I share those that I think could make good conversation starters 🙂

After trying out various platforms, the warm and welcoming aesthetic of this one really resonated with me; just looking at the template inspires creativity. It’s called Apéro— a French tradition of casual gatherings over apéritifs, snacks and anything in between. I hope you enjoy hanging out here, and take with you a thing or two!
