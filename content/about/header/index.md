I research the molecular causes of cardiovascular disease. I focus on DNA methylation, a mark sitting atop our DNA, that’s influenced by our lifestyles, genetics, and more. 

I am a graduate student the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, where I am learning how to apply various statistical and computational tools to interrogate, interpret and integrate clues from large datasets to understand how changes in DNA methylation can impact disease. 

When I am not working on my thesis, I enjoy writing about the many things that I’ve been privileged to learn and experience as a way of savoring life that can otherwise so quickly pass me by. ✏️
